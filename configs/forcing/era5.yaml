title: "ERA5 (subset) -> SHUD forcing"

# NOTE: Placeholder/spec file. We will fill the exact variable names/units
# once we lock down the ERA5 files we want to support (single-file-per-day,
# single-file-per-month, pressure-level vs single-level, etc).
#
# Goal: map ERA5 variables to SHUD forcing:
# - Precip (mm/day), Temp (C), RH (0-1), Wind (m/s), RN (W/m2)

layout:
  # Current local example (QHH subset):
  #   Data/Forcing/ERA5/qhh/2017/ERA5_20170104.nc
  #   Data/Forcing/ERA5/qhh/2018/ERA5_20180105.nc
  file_pattern: "ERA5_{yyyymmdd}.nc"

netcdf:
  dims:
    time: "time"
    lat: "latitude"
    lon: "longitude"

conversion:
  # To be confirmed from the NetCDF metadata:
  # - precip often in m (accumulated) or kg m-2; needs daily accumulation.
  # - temperature often in K -> C.
  # - RH may be provided directly or derived from (q, p, T) or (dewpoint, T).
  notes:
    - "Confirm variable names in the ERA5 NetCDFs (tp, t2m, d2m/q, sp, u10/v10, ssrd/strd...)."
    - "Define accumulation window for precipitation and radiation."
