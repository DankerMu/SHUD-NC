title: "SHUD output NetCDF schema (UGRID/CF-friendly)"

# Purpose:
# - Define a standard NetCDF output layout for SHUD results on unstructured mesh.
# - Enable downstream tooling (xarray, netCDF4, Panoply, QGIS, etc.).
#
# NOTE: Placeholder/spec file. The concrete schema will be implemented in SHUD/.

conventions:
  - CF-1.10
  - UGRID-1.0

mesh:
  # UGRID mesh topology variables (to be written once, reused for all time steps)
  topology_variable: "mesh"
  node_coordinates: ["mesh_node_x", "mesh_node_y"]
  face_node_connectivity: "mesh_face_nodes"
  start_index: 1

files:
  # Recommended layout (phase B): split by object type for clarity and tool support.
  element: "{prefix}.ele.nc"
  river: "{prefix}.riv.nc"
  lake: "{prefix}.lake.nc"

time:
  # Recommended: align with SHUD internal time axis (minutes since ForcStartTime).
  units: "minutes since <ForcStartTime YYYY-MM-DD> 00:00:00 UTC"
  calendar: "standard"

output:
  # Frequency is controlled by SHUD dt_* settings; NetCDF should follow Print_Ctrl.
  frequency: "dt_* driven"
  variables:
    # Example list (to be confirmed)
    - name: "streamflow"
      units: "m3 s-1"
      location: "river"
    - name: "soil_moisture"
      units: "m3 m-3"
      location: "cell"
