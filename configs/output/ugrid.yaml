title: "SHUD output NetCDF schema (UGRID/CF-friendly)"

# Purpose:
# - Define a standard NetCDF output layout for SHUD results on unstructured mesh.
# - Enable downstream tooling (xarray, netCDF4, Panoply, QGIS, etc.).
#
# NOTE: Placeholder/spec file. The concrete schema will be implemented in SHUD/.

conventions:
  - CF-1.10
  - UGRID-1.0

mesh:
  # UGRID mesh topology variables (to be written once, reused for all time steps)
  topology_variable: "mesh"
  node_coordinates: ["mesh_node_x", "mesh_node_y"]
  face_node_connectivity: "mesh_face_nodes"

time:
  units: "days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00"
  calendar: "standard"

output:
  frequency: "daily" # hourly | daily | monthly (target)
  variables:
    # Example list (to be confirmed)
    - name: "streamflow"
      units: "m3 s-1"
      location: "river"
    - name: "soil_moisture"
      units: "m3 m-3"
      location: "cell"
