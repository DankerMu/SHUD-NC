## Implementation
- [x] Create river NetCDF file with `time` and `river` dimensions and id variables
- [x] Create lake NetCDF file with `time` and `lake` dimensions and id variables
- [x] Route `Print_Ctrl` variables to correct file based on full dimension size (NumRiv/NumLake)

## Validation
- [x] Run a case that has rivers and (optionally) lakes
- [x] Open datasets with xarray and confirm dimensions
