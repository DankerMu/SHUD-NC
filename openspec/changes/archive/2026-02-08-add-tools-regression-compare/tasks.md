## Implementation
- [x] Add `tools/compare_forcing.py` (or integrate into `tools/shudnc.py compare`)
- [x] Add `tools/compare_output.py` for legacy vs netcdf sampled comparison
- [x] Document usage in `tools/README.md`

## Validation
- [x] Run compares on a short baseline and short nc run directory
- [x] Confirm summaries are readable and fail on large diffs (optional threshold)
