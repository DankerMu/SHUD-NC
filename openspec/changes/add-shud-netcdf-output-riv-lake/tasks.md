## Implementation
- [ ] Create river NetCDF file with `time` and `river` dimensions and id variables
- [ ] Create lake NetCDF file with `time` and `lake` dimensions and id variables
- [ ] Route `Print_Ctrl` variables to correct file based on full dimension size (NumRiv/NumLake)

## Validation
- [ ] Run a case that has rivers and (optionally) lakes
- [ ] Open datasets with xarray and confirm dimensions
